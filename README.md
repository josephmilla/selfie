## Inspiration

Selfies are awesome!

## How It Works

The project is a web application which runs on a Node.JS server. It can capture a video feed directly from the browser using WebRTC, and automatically transforms it to a GIF file. The file will then be uploaded to Imgur and will be available to share on Facebook, Twitter, and even to any phone through Twilio.

## What I Learned

Never code at the very last minute. Coding at 2AM is never fun.

## What's Next For Selfie?

- Capture the lat/long coordinates from the individual selfies taken and then map it
- Add GIF ranking system
- Better UI
